WASTEx 0.9
------------------

WASTEx is a fork of wxWaste, a multiplatform version of the WASTE mesh-network
file sharing application. WASTEx attempts to be more modern, by improving on
the portability and P2P features of WASTE.

Currently in 0.9, changes are made to make the application run under 64-bit
Linux. This version is preliminary; it uses size_t as a pointer-size integer,
which is unreliable and should be fixed.
