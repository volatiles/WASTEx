WASTEx builds on GCC. It is currently only supported on x86-64 Linux, but
should easily build to other systems as well.

Dependencies
------------------
WASTEx only depends on a few things: The presence of a C++ compiler,
GNU Make, GNU Bash, the autotools, wxWidgets and all of their dependencies.

Here are some commands for various operating systems to get you up to date.
Let us know <https://github.com/volatiles/WASTEx/issues> if we missed anything.

Debian/Ubuntu:
	apt-get install build-essential make libwxGTK2.8-dev wx-common

* Note: You can also use wxWidgets 2.6 if you use an old distro.

Configuring
------------------
If you got the package via source control, you may need to build the configure
script. Do this with the following:

	./autogen.sh

If this command fails, it's possible you need to install GNU autotools. Most
error messages are fatal even if they aren't listed as such.

Once this completes, follow up with the configure command.

	./configure

If the configure command fails, you may want to make sure it's not complaining
about a missing library or header. If it's a missing header, you may want to
file an issue. If it's a missing library, install it.

Now that configure is finished, we should have a makefile.

Compiling
------------------
To compile, simply issue the make command with no parameters.

	make

Once finished, you should see a new executable file in the cwd - 'wastex.'
You can run from the directory by issuing:

	./wastex

Installing
------------------
To install, run the following command:

	sudo make install

which will make WASTEx runnable with the command 'wastex.'
